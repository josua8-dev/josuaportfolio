              <h3 class="hobby-title-modern">Basketball</h3>
              <p class="hobby-description-modern"><span style="color: #ffae00; font-weight: 600;">The game that defines my competitive spirit.</span> <br><br> I have been training religiously for about 3 years now. Putting in the hours necessary to get better every day. All of the late nights and early mornings, waking up at 5am and waiting until 10pm so that the gym is free. All of this commitment will one day pay off. <br><br> <span style="font-size: 1.15rem; font-weight: 600; color: var(--text-primary);">Inspirations</span><br> There was always something about <strong>Kobe Bryant</strong> that made him different. I know I wasn't playing while he was still alive, but by the time I first watched one of his games I <em>fell in love with the game</em>. His work ethic was unmatched and his will to win was something I strived to have myself. <br><br> Alongside Kobe, <strong>Kyrie Irving</strong> has been a huge inspiration for me. His style of play is so creative and unique that it always amazes me to watch him on the court. <br><br> Basketball teaches me <span style="color: #ffae00; font-weight: 600;">discipline</span>, <strong>teamwork</strong>, and the value of <span style="color: #ffae00; font-weight: 600;">consistent practice</span>.</p>

              <p class="hobby-description-modern"><span style="color: #ffae00; font-weight: 600;">Completed my first Marathon on the 2nd of November 2025.</span> <br><br> After failing my first attempt earlier this year, I was determined to try again and succeed. There was no question that I wouln't be able to do it. <br><br> The hardest part of it all was me deciding to do this without any prior long distance training. Playing Basketball isn't really a long-distance endurance sport, so this was a new <span style="color: #ffae00; font-weight: 600;">challenge</span> for me. However it was all the more <span style="color: #ffae00; font-weight: 600;">rewarding</span>. <br><br> Running teaches me <span style="color: #ffae00; font-weight: 600;">patience</span>, <strong>resilience</strong>, and the importance of <span style="color: #ffae00; font-weight: 600;">setting goals</span>.</p>
